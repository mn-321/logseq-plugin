## 2026-10-20 · Faster map and choices within Logseq's limits (0.4.190, 0.4.191)

**Done means:** the faster tag map on main; making a choice its own child tag keeps the old choice and Undo puts the
graph back exactly; "Add a choice" leads to Logseq's own settings instead of failing.

**Owner's pick:** keep the old choice in the list when it becomes a child tag; the owner removes it when nothing needs it.

**Checks:** `check.sh` passed; the tag map redraw on the pretend 600-tag graph shows a change in 105 to 124 ms, nothing
moved, with the limit back at 0.4 s.

**Seen in Logseq (0.4.191):** the dialog for "Pathology" on #Report says the choice stays. Making it moved both
pathology reports (28 tags, 23 reports), the message read "2 nodes moved to #Pathology; “Pathology” is still a choice
of kind", and Undo brought back 27 tags and 25 reports; the graph check matched the fingerprint exactly. The choices
panel shows "Add a choice in its settings ⇥", which opens the kind property in the right sidebar.

**On the way:** the dialog had grown a line, so two clicks at the old place of its button missed (nothing happened,
the graph check agreed). Opening the kind property's page made Logseq save an "All" view; removed.

**Not checked:** renaming a tag, changing what a link accepts, renaming or moving a choice, description editing.

## 2026-10-20 · Second reading, tour fixes, merged (0.4.189)

**Second reader:** nothing serious; three small faults in the tour (a logged value that cannot become text could break
the logging, two quick starts could run two tours, ending mid-stop left its measuring running) and two lesser ones.
All fixed in 0.4.189.

**On main:** the checking system, the tour, the dark-mode fix and these fixes, merged and pushed; the Mac folder is on
`main`. The faster tag map and the child-tag action stay on `claude/project-thread-ocmi6u` until the owner decides how
the child-tag action treats the old choice. On main the tag map's speed limit for a change is 1.5 s (the map there
takes about 1 s on the Mac); it goes back to 0.4 s when the faster map joins.

**Seen in Logseq (0.4.189), light theme:** Dr. Mei Chen, Appointment, Nausea and Northgate Cancer Center look right;
the rows come with the title (42 to 87 ms), nothing of the plugin moved, no errors. Starting the tour again ended it
at once, wrote "ended early" and put the dark theme back.

## 2026-10-19 · Trial run on the tag map close-out

**Done means:** the tour runs in the real app; the faster tag map (`f9c6d88`, `38eb6f3` from the "Close out map work
on Mac" session) and its child-tag action work, and Undo puts the graph back exactly.

**Tour (0.4.187, dark theme):** all 12 stops visited. The plugin's rows came with the page title (36 to 51 ms after
opening), nothing of the plugin's moved, Logseq logged no errors, the plugin no warnings. Only the Appointment tag
page moved (score 0.28 on a first visit, 0.05 on the second), all of it Logseq's own table filling in, as known. The
tag map opened and drew normally with the faster redraw.

**Found and fixed (0.4.188):** the troubleshooting box and the settings window were see-through in dark mode. Cause:
Logseq 2.0.2 leaves `--ls-primary-background-color` and its siblings unset in dark mode. A picture of the box over a
page now holds it in place. Seen fixed in the app.

**Found, not fixed (needs a decision):**
- *Adding a choice from the map has never worked in the real app.* Logseq refuses it ("Invalid data writing to db!").
  Logseq 2.0.2 lets a plugin turn only an existing value of the property into a choice, and does not let a plugin
  make a new value for a property it did not create (`ensure-property-upsert-control`, `add-existing-values-to-closed-values!`
  in Logseq's own code). One fix tried (set the value on the property's page first): Logseq would not make the value.
  The way out that fits the map's other limits: "Add a choice" opens the property's own settings in the sidebar.
- *The child-tag action works, its Undo does not.* Making "Pathology" (kind, on #Report) its own child tag moved both
  pathology reports to #Pathology with every value kept, cleared the old value and removed the choice. Undo then
  failed at its first step, bringing the choice back, for the reason above. Logseq's own Cmd+Z does put it all back
  (nine steps), but also leaves "kind: Pathology" on the kind property's own page, which had to be taken off by hand.
  Decision for the owner: keep the choice when making the child tag (Undo then works fully, and the unused choice is
  removed from the map afterwards), or remove it and accept that Undo cannot bring it back.

**Graph check:** caught every leftover. Twice the test edits were not undone at first (once the Undo bar had gone
before it was pressed, once Undo failed); both times the graph check named exactly what differed, and the graph was
put back until it matched (922 pages and blocks).

**Mistakes of mine on the way:** typing into the developer console through the screen missed once and the keys went
to Logseq: it opened Settings → Keymap and the right sidebar. Nothing in the graph or the shortcuts changed (checked);
both closed again. Lesson in PROCESS.md: no typing into the console through the screen.

**Not checked:** light theme in the real app (the tour started in dark, and its light stop came last); renaming a
tag, changing what a link accepts, renaming or moving a choice, description editing (item 4 of the close-out).

## 2026-10-19 · The checking system itself

**Done means:** every check in PROCESS.md runs on the Mac; a deliberate change makes the pictures fail; the graph
check says the test graph is unchanged when nothing was done.

**Changed:** nothing on screen in normal use. New: node installed in the home folder (`~/.local/node`, linked from
`~/.local/bin`), with jsdom, Playwright and its Chromium in the project's `node_modules` (not committed). New checks:
`tools/pictures.js` (tag map and two-way rows, light and dark), `tools/graph-check.js` (fingerprint of the test
graph). The tag map speed limits on the Mac went from 3 s / 3.5 s to 1 s / 0.4 s. A troubleshooting tool, "Take the
tour (F8 for the next stop)".

**Checks:** `check.sh` all passed, including the boot test, 123 model checks, the tag map speed (first drawing 317 ms,
changes 102 to 132 ms, nothing moved) and the four pictures. Changing one number in the two-way rows made both
two-way pictures fail, as it should; put back. The graph check saved and compared the Illness Test Graph: 922 pages
and blocks, as it was.

**Not checked:** the tour in real Logseq. The screen was locked, so Logseq could not be controlled.
