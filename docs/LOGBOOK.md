Newest first. One entry per piece of work, in the shape `docs/PROCESS.md` describes.

## 2026-10-19 · The checking system itself

**Done means:** every check in PROCESS.md runs on the Mac; a deliberate change makes the pictures fail; the graph
check says the test graph is unchanged when nothing was done.

**Changed:** nothing on screen in normal use. New: node installed in the home folder (`~/.local/node`, linked from
`~/.local/bin`), with jsdom, Playwright and its Chromium in the project's `node_modules` (not committed). New checks:
`tools/pictures.js` (tag map and two-way rows, light and dark), `tools/graph-check.js` (fingerprint of the test
graph). The tag map speed limits on the Mac went from 3 s / 3.5 s to 1 s / 0.4 s. A troubleshooting tool, "Take the
tour (F8 for the next stop)".

**Checks:** `check.sh` all passed, including the boot test, 123 model checks, the tag map speed (first drawing 317 ms,
changes 102 to 132 ms, nothing moved) and the four pictures. Changing one number in the two-way rows made both
two-way pictures fail, as it should; put back. The graph check saved and compared the Illness Test Graph: 922 pages
and blocks, as it was.

**Not checked:** the tour in real Logseq. The screen was locked, so Logseq could not be controlled.
