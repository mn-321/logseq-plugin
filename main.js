// model, which every part reads the graph through (core.provided). sidebar.js right after
// chrome.js: its settings have no heading of their own, so they join chrome's "Sidebars and toolbar".
// Resting (0.4.175, at the owner's word: "just running the foundations and tag tree ... for the sake of understanding
// what is important"): the plugin loads only the foundation, the tag and property map, and the two-way links that the
// map writes the wording of. The other parts stay in parts/ unchanged, listed in RESTING_FILES (never loaded; the
// check compares parts/ with both lists), and come back one layer at a time, each by moving its file back into
// PART_FILES at its old place: editor, pages, properties, links after diagnostics; the rest after two-way.
