/* Is the Mac quiet enough to measure speed? (2026-10-23, docs/FINISHING-PROMPT.md section 4, "Load"; the loose end of
   CLAUDE.md section 7: the tag map's speed limits failed whenever the Mac's load was above about 2, as it is while the
   Claude app renders a long session.)
   - load():  the one-minute load average (sysctl vm.loadavg on a Mac, os.loadavg() elsewhere);
   - idle():  seconds since the last key or mouse input (ioreg on a Mac; Infinity elsewhere);
   - quiet(): load under 2, over the last minute and over the last five (a run once began in a moment's dip under 2
     while the Mac had been at 3 for minutes, and its times were judged as a quiet Mac's, 2026-10-23);
   - waitQuiet({ minutes, needIdle }): waits, a reading every 30 s, until quiet (and, with needIdle, no input for 120 s),
     at most `minutes`; returns { quiet, load, idle, waited }.
   The speed tests use it as a gate: on a quiet Mac a speed limit is the limit; on a busy one (still busy after the
   wait) the same measure is taken of the previous version (HEAD) in the same run, and a change fails only when it is
   more than 25% slower than that under the same load. A limit is never raised. */
