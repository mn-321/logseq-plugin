# Each is also runnable alone; each says in its header what it does, what fails it and why.
#   node tools/model-test.js --big    the model on 100,000 pages and 600 properties: every door about linear
#   node tools/shadow-stress.js       the proposals: tricky words, random text, odd names, a large pretend graph
#   node tools/odd-text-test.js       odd names through the kit, the two-way rows, the tag map and the model's readers
#   node tools/tags-stress.js         the tag map: 200 drags, Undo in rounds, renames, both views, 1000 holders, 200 keys, memory
#   node tools/app-stress.js          the real Logseq (over its debugging port): pages many and fast, a typing storm,
#                                     theme / sidebar / size, twenty reloads and Foundation only, every pop-up in dark
#   node tools/app-frames.js          every tour stop recorded off and on, light and dark (the frame test of the real app)
# The speed parts wait for a quiet Mac and are gated on its load (tools/quiet.js).
