/* The plumbing of layer 1 that lives in the plugin's frame, and THE KIT (layer 2, docs/LAYERS.md section 3): the
   pieces every part draws with, each drawn once, with one stylesheet. This header is the contract between the files.

   WHAT THIS FILE PROVIDES, on window.refinementShared (and nothing else):

   Layer 1, talking to Logseq from the frame (the engine itself, the watcher, the database round, the command register
   and the screen door are in main.js; the graph in parts/model.js):
   - host()                      the Logseq document (the plugin runs in a frame inside Logseq's window).
   - notify(message, level)      THE notice: an in-app message at the top, through Logseq's own.
   - lifecycle({ prefix, stopKey, before, sweep, leaves })   one per part; returns
       warnOnce(message, ...details)   a console warning written once per session per message, with the
                                       part's prefix ('Refinements: ', 'Refinements (search): ', …);
       onUnload(task)                  adds a clean-up step (also takes the "off" function of a Logseq hook);
       runUnloadTasks()                runs the steps in reverse order (after `before`, if given) and
                                       returns a promise that waits for any step that finishes later;
       takeOverFromEarlierCopy()       runs the earlier copy's clean-up left under window[stopKey] in
                                       Logseq's window, leaves this one there, then calls sweep(doc);
       leaves: { elements, attributes, reset }   what the part may leave on screen if a copy is cut short:
                                       a selector list of its own elements, the names of the attributes it
                                       sets on Logseq's elements, and a reset(doc) for anything else. The
                                       core sweeps every part's leaves before it starts (sweepLeftovers).
   - sweepLeftovers(doc)          removes what every part declared in its leaves, part by part.
       updaterFailed(fn, error, list)  retires a screen updater that threw five times;
       listen(win, types, handler)     a capture-phase listener on Logseq's window, removed on unload.
   - take(core, names, warn)      the core's and the parts' things in one object, warning once (through the part's own
                                  warnOnce) for each name missing; every part's take() is this (0.4.294).
   - feature(name)                the bag the pieces of one feature share (the proposals, the tag map), by name.
   - screen                       THE screen door (core.screen): waitFor, press, typeInto, key, floating, item, sidebarItems,
                                  popupOpen, escapeMenus: the one way to work Logseq's own boxes.
   - openEntity(uuid, inSidebar)  opens a page or block by uuid, in the right sidebar when asked.
   - openPageNamed(name, inSidebar)   opens a page by its name the same way.
   - settingReader(schema)        returns setting(key): the saved value, or the schema's default when
                                  the saved value is missing or of another type.
   - graphNamedIn(list)           true when the open graph is named in the comma-separated list (an "Only in
                                  these graphs" setting); false while the list is empty.
   - perf                         measuring hooks (add, time, seen, style, frameState, pass, passDone,
                                  ownSettingsOnly): no-ops until the diagnostics part measures.
   - warnings                     every distinct warnOnce message of this session (message, first time, count).

   Layer 2, the kit (0.4.311; the picture is docs/ELEMENTS.html and docs/VIEWS.html, the words docs/LAYERS.md). A part
   draws nothing of its own: it uses these and adds only its own layout. A new kind of thing goes in here first.
   - kitCss                       THE stylesheet: the greys, the pop-up, the dialog, the three buttons, the field,
                                  the tick box, the words for chips, the tag, the kind icons, the picking bar, the
                                  hover card, the Undo arrow, the quiet line and the help paragraph. Sent by main.js
                                  before any part. Colours: Logseq's --popover pair and the text colour; the four
                                  greys mixed from currentColor (quiet .7, faint .5, hairline 12%, line 26%, wash 7%).
   - el(doc, tag, props, ...children)   THE element builder: class, html (parsed), a function is a listener, true
                                  is an empty attribute, null and false are skipped.
   - esc(text)                    THE text escaper for innerHTML.
   - ICONS, icon(doc, name), iconHtml(name)   THE icon list: a meaning ('undo', 'sidebar', 'tag'…) or a Tabler name,
                                  drawn from Logseq's own icon font (<i class="ti ti-…">), never by the plugin.
   - KINDS, kindIcon(doc, kind, { several })   a value's kind as an icon: an arrow for a link to a node, the arrow
                                  twice for several, a calendar, Aa, 123, a box with a chevron for a choice.
   - tag(doc, title, props)       a tag as a class: its name alone, no #, mono, the tag grey, a link to its page (plain:
                                  true where a click already chooses); tagLinkHtml(title) the same as words.
   - quiet(doc, { icon, label, title, faint, pressed, run })   the quiet button; go(doc, { label, run }) the one that
                                  does what was asked; pressed is a quiet button with aria-pressed="true".
   - field(doc, { placeholder, value, icon, kbd, inline, multiline, keys, input })   THE field: a real text box drawn
                                  as a hairline underneath (a few lines tall with multiline); keys typed in it never
                                  reach Logseq; .input is the box.
   - drawnField(doc, { text, placeholder, fresh, kbd })   the same look with drawn text and a drawn caret: only for the
                                  link box, whose keystrokes must keep going to the bullet.
   - tick(doc, { checked, label, title, change })   the browser's tick box as a small rounded square.
   - chip(doc, { label, pressed, run, remove })     a filter (greyed, the one in force in the text colour) or a
                                  removable item (a word with a × on hover); never a pill.
   - note(doc, text), guide(doc, paragraphs)        the quiet line; the help paragraph with a hairline down its left.
   - choices(doc, { items, picked, pick })          quiet words to pick one of, on a line, with their icons.
   - popup({ at, kind, head, items, field, rows, manual, hint, cls, width, onClose })   THE pop-up: the browser's
                                  popover, placed under its anchor (an element or a rect) by CSS anchor positioning
                                  and flipped when there is no room, dismissed by the browser on Escape or a click
                                  outside; a menu filling (items: icon, label, kbd, on, run) or a list filling (the
                                  field, then rows(query)); Up, Down and Enter handled here. Returns { el, close,
                                  items, lit, field, query, closed }. popups.closeAll() closes every open one (unload).
   - ask({ at, question, note, go, cancel, field })   a question beside what it is about: Cancel and the one that
                                  does it as words; resolves true/false, or the field's text / null (field.select
                                  starts with its words selected; multiline takes Shift-Enter for a new line).
   - dialog({ build, cls, width })   THE window: the browser's <dialog>, shown modal, dressed; for settings only.
   - bar(doc, { count, total, actions, clear, all })   the picking bar: the count with its tick box, the actions as
                                  quiet words with icons, a hairline under it; .update({ count, total }).
   - card({ at, title, tag, day, fields, lines, empty, open })   the hover card: a node's preview, every piece clickable
                                  (open(what, value, event): 'node', 'tag', 'day', 'prop', 'value', 'line').
   - undo                         THE Undo (0.4.258): undo.offer({ key, at, text, run, onFail, cls, data }) puts a
                                  faded arrow at the end of at()'s element(s), or at the bottom right when there is
                                  none; forget, clear, draw, size, has, stop.

   WHAT EVERY OTHER PART MUST DO:
   - wrap itself in its own scope, `(() => { … })();`
   - take what it needs from window.refinementShared (`const shared = window.refinementShared;`), and
     make its own lifecycle with its own prefix and, when it cleans up Logseq's window, its own stopKey,
     so that a reload still stops each part's earlier copy on its own;
   - push { name, schema, provide?, start, ready?, commands?, moved?, foundation?, stop } onto window.refinementParts
     (foundation: true keeps the part running under the setting Foundation only: the model, the troubleshooting
     tools and the settings window);
     main.js joins the schemas, in the order of PART_FILES, after its own, and from main() calls every
     part's provide(core), then every start(), then every ready() (what draws on screen, once every part
     has started), and stop() at unload; it puts each command in the one register ({ key, label, run, shortcut,
     binding, icon, places }: main.js says what each is) and moves a saved setting named in moved
     ({ key: [old default, new default] }). The core starts no part by name.
   - call Logseq only through layer 1: the graph through parts/model.js, the screen through core.screen, a
     command through the register, a notice through notify; never logseq.* itself (docs/LAYERS.md section 1);
   - bring its own troubleshooting: what it looks for on screen and any tool of its own, through
     core.provided.addTroubleshooting({ checks, tools }) from parts/diagnostics.js (0.4.172), never by
     the troubleshooting part reaching into it.

   LOAD ORDER AND WHY: loader.js → main.js → parts/shared.js → parts/model.js → the other parts → main().
   loader.js loads main.js with a fresh timestamp (Logseq caches a plugin's script between reloads);
   main.js loads the parts the same way, this file first, because the others read
   window.refinementShared as they load, and parts/model.js second: the one part that knows what a page,
   block, tag, property, journal day and link are in a DB graph (titles, the stored form of a link, the
   property schema, the pages, days, journal titles, the Logseq version checked with). It provides them
   through core.provided, so every other part reads the graph through it with take(); the core itself knows
   nothing of content. main.js itself takes its helpers from here once the parts
   have loaded (useShared), before it gives Logseq the settings and before main() runs, and main()
   publishes window.refinementCore before it starts any part. */

/* THE Undo of the plugin (0.4.258, at the owner's word: "make one pop-up, one Undo and one dialog"; its look is the
   proposals' faded arrow of 0.4.218, which the owner chose over the bar: "the undo toast notification is in an awful place
   and loud and too far down and distracting. it should be something just where text is but very subtle, like a faded
   icon"). After a change, a faded arrow sits beside what changed and says what it takes back when pointed at; a click
   takes it back. Each change keeps its own arrow until it is used, the page is left (main.js clears them), or the part
   forgets it, so a second change never takes the first one's Undo away (the bar did). A change offered again under the
   same key adds to that arrow: one click takes both back, the later first. When nothing of the change is on screen to
   sit beside (the nodes were deleted), the arrow waits at the bottom right with its words beside it, quiet, until used
   or the page is left. The old dark bar at the bottom is gone (0.4.311).
