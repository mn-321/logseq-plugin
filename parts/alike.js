/* The "looks like" engine (0.4.212, proposals piece 3; docs/ALIKE.md): a new bullet is filled the way the nodes it
   most resembles were filled. Built at the owner's word, 2026-10-20: the guess rules were "too based on the current
   graph instead of developing a more dynamic and fluid system with less friction". Nothing here knows the graph's
   tags or words; the graph itself is the only knowledge, and it changes as the owner writes.

   How: every remembered node is a bag of tokens, its words (lower-case, lightly stemmed, so "flagged" and
   "flagging" meet), the pages it links (link:id) and its tags (tag:id). A rare token weighs more (inverse document
   frequency: "neutrophils" says more than "day"). The bullet being written is tokened the same way, and the nearest
   nodes are found by the cosine of the weighted bags through an inverted index, so only nodes sharing a token are
   touched. For a property, the nearest nodes that hold it vote for their value, each with the square of its similarity; the
   leading value wins when it is clearly ahead and the nearest node is near enough (vote). The numbers in `limits`
   are picked by the scorer (tools/shadow-check.js), never by hand; docs/ALIKE.md keeps the scoreboard.

   WHAT IT PROVIDES (core.provided.alike):
   - tokensOf(words, links, tags)          the bag of tokens of a node or of the bullet being written
   - buildIndex(entries)                   { id, tokens, values: Map(ident -> ids) } each; the index the rest read
   - neighbours(index, tokens, options)    the k nearest entries, [{ entry, sim }], best first; options.skip (ids),
                                           options.keep(entry), options.k
   - vote(near, ident, limits)             { ids, share, sim } the value the nearest holders agree on, or null
   - limits                                { k, nearLeast, lead }, read on each call, so the scorer can try others */
